# ExtendScriptAutoCompleteForJetBrainsIDEs

Provided auto-completion and type-hinting for JetBrains IDEs when editing ExtendScript JSX files

warnings. Use this library to eliminate such warnings and receive code completion suggestions.

Should work with:  
- PhpStorm

7) Navigate to the library on your local drive and click 'OK'
